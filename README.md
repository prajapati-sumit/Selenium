Report Progress:

I was exploring Selenium and I came across pretty interesting stuffs.

I did 2 things using Selenium as of now.

1) Google Form Automation:

    One of my school friends asked me to fill out the following 
    [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWAKVBv3yWlfRNvZQ5Ct0PamxM1k_1tDt5fm0ApHqIbZZu1w/viewform?usp=sf_link) for a survey which his institute was conducting.
    
    He told me to fill me atleast 2-3 entries. I could fill it under any alias name and email address.
    So I used Selenium to do so.

2) CTF:
    The task was to copy the given 'key' in the website and paste it in the input box and press submit, all these under 1 sec.
