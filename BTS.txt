Report Progress:

I was exploring Selenium as said and I came 
across pretty interesting stuffs.

I did 2 things using Selenium as of now.

1)Google Form Automation:

    One of my school friends asked me to fill out the following 
    Google Form -(https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWAKVBv3yWlfRNvZQ5Ct0PamxM1k_1tDt5fm0ApHqIbZZu1w/viewform?usp=sf_link)
    for a survey which his institute was conducting.

    He told me to fill me atleast 2-3 entries.
    Plus point was that I could fill it under any alias name and email_adress.

    So I used Selenium to do so.

2)CTF:
    The task was to copy the given 'key' in the website and paste it in the input box and press submit, all these under 1 sec.
